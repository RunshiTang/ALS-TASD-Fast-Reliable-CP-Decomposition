# ALS-TASD: Fast and Reliable CP Tensor Decomposition

This repo contains the code for the full procedure TASD-ALS in the paper "Revisit CP Tensor Decomposition: Statistical Optimality and Fast Convergence" by Runshi Tang, Julien Chhor, Olga Klopp, and Anru Zhang.

The function tasd_als in tasd_als.R is the master function that performs our full procedure.
