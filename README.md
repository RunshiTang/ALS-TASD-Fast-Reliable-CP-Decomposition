# ALS-TASD-Fast-Reliable-CP-Decomposition

This repo contains the code for the paper Revisit-CP-Tensor-Decomposition-Statistical-Optimality-and-Fast-Convergence. 

The function our_method_new in helpers.R is the master function that performs our full procedure. Othere R files replicates the simulation results in the paper.
